This documentation assumes you are fairly confortable with :mod:`unittest`.

Introduction
============

Let's say you are writing a class ``Stats`` that performs basic statistics on integer numbers.
This class needs some source of integers.
Using dependency injection, you pass a ``source`` object to the constructor of ``Stats``.
In real execution, it could read integers from keyboard or from a file.
For your unit-tests, you can mock this source to simulate all kinds of behaviours.

So, here is how you would do that with PyMockMockMock. Create a test case::

    import unittest
    from MockMockMock import Mock

    from Stats import Stats

    class MyTestCase(unittest.TestCase):
        def setUp(self):

In ``setUp``, you create the mock...

::

    .       self.source = Mock("source")

... and inject it in your constructor::

    .       self.stats = Stats(self.source.object)

In ``tearDown``, you check that each mock has been used correctly::

    .   def tearDown(self):
            self.source.tearDown()

Then, in your test methods, there are two phases. First, instruct the mock about how to behave...

::

    .   def testAverage(self):
            self.source.expect.get().and_return([42, 43, 44])

... then call your code, that will call the mock.

::

    .       self.assertEqual(self.stats.average(), 43)

This way, you:

- are checking that your code calls what it has to call (the final call to Mock.tearDown will detect if some call was ``expect`` ed, but not called)
- can inject to your code wathever behaviour you want to test.

Of course, do not forget to actually run the tests::

    unittest.main()

Mock behaviour
--------------

Expectations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can instruct the mock to expect successive calls::

        def testXxxx(self):
            self.source.expect.get().and_return([1, 2, 3, 4])
            self.source.expect.isFinished().and_return(True)

            self.assertEqual(self.stats.average(), 2.5)

You can expect successive calls to the same method and have different behaviour each time::

        def testXxxx(self):
            self.source.expect.get().and_return([1, 2, 3, 4])
            self.source.expect.get().and_return([5, 6, 7])
            self.source.expect.get().and_return([])

            self.assertEqual(self.stats.average(), 4)

You can expect arguments in method calls::

        def testXxxx(self):
            self.source.expect.get(5).and_return([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

            self.assertEqual(self.stats.average(), 3)

You can expect calls to properties as well::

        def testXxxx(self):
            self.source.expect.name.and_return("Mock")

            self.assertEqual(self.stats.getSourceName(), "Mock")

Behaviour
~~~~~~~~~

You can simulate a source that raises exceptions::

        def testXxxx(self):
            self.source.expect.get().and_raise(Exception())

            self.assertRaises(Exception, self.stats.average)

Mock grouping
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, all ``expect`` ed calls are registered in an ``ordered`` group.
This means that the mock will raise a ``MockException`` if your code does not call those methods in the order they were ``expect`` ed.
The `Mock.tearDown` method will raise ``MockException`` as if your code does not call all the ``expect`` ed methods.

To tweak this behaviour, there are several other available grouping methods.

You can tell the mock to expect all calls, but in any order::

        def testXxxx(self):
            with self.source.unordered:
                self.source.expect.foobar()
                self.source.expect.barbaz()

            self.stats.frobnicate()

You can tell the mock that some calls are optional::

        def testXxxx(self):
            with self.source.optional:
                self.source.expect.foobar()
                self.source.expect.barbaz()

            self.stats.frobnicate()
